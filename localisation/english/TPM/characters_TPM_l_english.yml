  TPM_the_chief_advisor_desc:0 "Sometimes the chief just has to roll up his sleeves and do the big jobs himself. Patrol Chief Callahan used to lead the Fifth Patrol group back in the day, and he remembers his time with them fondly. Whenever he gets the chance, he finds it refreshing to head out on patrol with them. They never do risky stuff when the chief's around, but the chief goes out of his way to find the riskiest ways to make boring patrols fun, and the boys love 'em for it."

  TPM_franklin:0 "Generations of Experience"
  TPM_franklin_advisor_desc:0 ""Old Man" Franklin's been in the patrol for a long, long time. He's in his 80s now, and despite working alongside his third generation of Patrol Chief Callahans, he's showing no signs of slowing down. He's a very careful and methodical fellow when trusted with the job of commanding troops other than his own immediate Patrol group, but he commands just as much respect in the Patrol as the chief does, and nobody can deny that if he's given proper time to think about a problem he's usually able to draw on his half-century's worth of experience to come up with a suspiciously good solution. He's probably going to have to retire soon, but he's stuck around long enough to know that he'll sooner have a luncheon with the reaper than put down his gun."
  
  TPM_grant:0 "Bayou Born"
  TPM_grant_advisor_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Casey Grant is one of the youngest members of the Patrolmen to have reached the rank of command, but it wasn't a rank he didn't earn. Born to a second-generation pioneer couple in the Cannery proper, he decided early on that fishing and factory work weren't for him and he went adventuring inland, just to get caught up in a bandit raid on a Patrolmen base by the Bluff. He was captured, but when he told the patrols who he was and where he was from, they decided to take Casey in and make him one of their own. Since that day he's felt strong loyalties both to his home in The Cannery and to the Gold and Blue that set him down the straight and narrow. He'd like to head home someday to try his hand at his family's craft of boat-making, but until such a time as that becomes possible, he fully intends to do his duty for the Patrol and help watch the rivers for pirates and other sources of unwanted trouble."
  
  TPM_george:0 "Historically Inspired"
  TPM_george_advisor_desc:0 "The oldest man in the 5th Patrol group, Lead Sheriff George has always had a thing for pre-war tech. Most other folks in Lafayette look at pre-war America as a nostalgic time worth talking about only for the movies and books they produced back then, but George is uniquely fascinated with the idea of casual air travel. Now that the wasteland's technology is finally starting to catch back up to how things were before America's collapse, the 63-year-old sheriff is hoping he lives long enough to see air travel from city to city become a reality again. It's a romantic dream, sure, but it's George's big dream, and he'd be mighty happy if it was fulfilled."
  
  TPM_mac_trait:0 "Friendly Drunkard"
  TPM_advisor_mac_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Rocky "The Bastard" Mack is by far and above the most entertaining man in the upper echelons of the 10th Lafayette Patrolmen to put in a room and see what happens. A chronic alcoholic since his youth, he's seen his fair share of battles, led his fair share of patrols, and made his fair share of arrests and collections. An utterly mediocre career was made all the more impressive by the fact that throughout the vast majority of his time in the service, he's been drunk on-duty. When his original patrol lead first noticed something was off with his his cognitive abilities, it was only because Mack had gone through an entire bottle of moonshine that morning. Since that point, Mack has been given the designation of the hammer of the patrol—he's nothing special on the day-to-day basis of things, but if you give him a dangerous patrol and impossible orders, he'll take his men and find a way through the sacred power of liquid courage."
  
  TPM_cunningham:0 "Rat Sniffer"
  TPM_advisor_cunningham_desc:0 "Having been the first man in the patrol to figure out a childhood friend and a fellow lawman had turned traitor to a bribe from Alexandria's Gator Gang, Lead Sheriff Joshua Cunningham has cultivated a useful level of social paranoia. Hard to approach and harder to earn trust with, Cunningham has been given the job of "checking out" anything that feels even the slightest bit off with the state of the Patrolmen. If someone asks the wrong question, shows up at the wrong place, or is late to a meeting he had no right to be late to, Cunningham is usually the first to investigate and the last to forget the incident."
  
  TPM_grenham:0 "Pirate Basher"
  TPM_advisor_grenham_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Michael Grenham is a close friend of the chief's, as he signed up for the Patrol alongside Callahan back in both their youths. Childhood friend turned brother-in-arms through the comradery of the Patrol, Callahan can always trust Grenham to hold the line when the going gets rough, and he was the natural pick for promotion to Patrol Lead for the 5th after Callahan formally took over the job of Patrol Chief. Grenham's Patrol just happened to be in the neighborhood when a mutant pirate captain tried to raid the Cannery town on Marsh Island, and despite not being asked to help, they jumped at the chance for action and held the line against the pirate's assault long enough for the Bayou's coastal defense force to chase them off. The chief was also at that operation, but he got knocked unconscious and it was Grenham who informally led the brunt of the defense, as he is ever-so-fond of reminding everyone who asks."
  
  TPM_andrews:0 "Everything's Bigger"
  TPM_andrews_advisor_desc:0 "Originally a deputy in the service of the Texan Brotherhood's own lawkeeper group, Mitchell Andrews was born and raised in Brotherhood-occupied Dallas. He holds no particular loyalty to the city of Lafayette or to the badge he's working to earn, but he does have an undeniable loyalty to the Patrolmen as an organization and to his Patrol as individuals. He left Texas in the first place because he felt the lawmen there were becoming too institutionalized. There wasn't as much adventure, and the only action for patrols came when formal wars raged between the Brotherhood and their raider neighbors. In the more lawless lands of west Louisiana he's found more adventure, and he's excited to bring his expertise to bear with his newfound family. He's nothing special with regards to the Patrolmen at large, but experience with Brotherhood combined arms tactics means he's got quite a few pointers to give should Lafayette ever decide to invest in less traditional methods of fighting."
  
  TPM_gary:0 "Voice of Reason"
  TPM_gary_advisor_desc:0 "Gary is a real, honest-to-goodness buzzkill. Known for being the most cautious man in the Patrolmen at large, Gary leads the 3rd Patrol group on the routes and missions that require the most patient and delicate touches. As such, it's just as common for folks to request to transfer into his group as out of it, and the reputation of the 3rd has only reinforced Gary's already-cautious attitude towards life in general. With him at Callahan's side in times of greatest danger, most of the troops on the ground can rest assured that no matter what else happens, they will be taken care of and not thrown away for nothing."
  
  TPM_rockwell:0 "Trainee Overseer"
  TPM_rockwell_advisor_desc:0 "Lead Sheriff Rockwell is directly responsible for exactly the type of apathy that Callahan's been trying to cut back on in the Patrolmen lately. But for as much as the chief might like to strip the donut-gobbling glutton of his badge, Callahan can't help but both like and admire Rockwell's pluck. Perfectly direct and bitterly honest, Rockwell was recently put in charge of training new recruits for the exact reason that his inconsiderate honesty makes him the closest thing Lafayette has to a drill sergeant. If someone's not doing well in their training to join up with the patrol, Rockwell's got his eye on them and he'll let them know directly. And as long as there's plenty of donuts at the weekend lead meetings and plenty of new folks to bark orders and insults at, Rockwell couldn't be a happier camper."
  
  TPM_francis:0 "The Red Wire"
  TPM_francis_advisor_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Francis is, admittedly, one of the least useful Patrol Leads in the Patrolmen. He's a rather passive individual who's been responsible for more than one failures of imagination that resulted in bandits getting away, and his predictably methodical method of running his patrol group has resulted in a disconnect between the general comradery of the Patrolmen at large and the folks under his direction. However, for what he lacks in social standing and effective leadership, he more than makes up for in technical knowledge and improvised innovation. Francis has been responsible for cracking open an abandoned pre-war arms cache and disarming a massive improvised bomb at multiple points over his curious career, and Callahan's long had Francis running what little official research capabilities the Patrolmen have been capable of making use of. Bright kid, despite everything."
  
  TPM_danny:0 "Everyone's Favorite"
  TPM_danny_advisor_desc:0 "Though not an official member of the Patrol, Dynamite Danny might as well be on equal footing with the chief in terms of reliable usefulness. An arms dealer by trade, he has extensive connections with the various inter-wasteland businesses shipping weapons and tools from who knows where to who else knows where, and a fair bit of the time those weapons and tools end up in his shop in Lafayette. Of course, his main customers have been the Patrolmen for as long as he's been alive, and he's used to cutting special deals with the Patrolmen in exchange for certain other favors and services. Danny's a special guy with special needs, and a lot of the time he's able to give information on bandit locations before the Patrolmen even know who the bandits are. It's not corruption as long as the dishonest ones get locked up at the Patrol's earliest convenience, of course."
   
  TPM_shank:0 "200 Years of Savvy"
  TPM_shank_advisor_desc:0 "If there's anyone in Lafayette who knows how to cut a deal, it's Louis Fletcher. Though he's technically the oldest man in the Patrolmen, he hasn't been involved in active patrols for at least the last hundred years. Being one of the surprisingly few original citizens of Lafayette who survived the bombs dropping while getting ghoulified instead of outright killed or passively poisoned, he alone refused to leave the ruins of his old home at the outskirts of the city center, and that's where he's been ever since, serving as an experienced one-man jury for brokering deals among civil disputes. Given Lafayette doesn't have an organized code of written laws and more or less relies on the Patrolmen to keep the respectable peace and use good moral judgement to make healthy decisions for the city at large, Fletcher serves as the middle ground for solving disputes when they can't be solved by face-to-face talking but the parties involved don't want to bring it to the Patrol's attention. As long as both sides beforehand agree to respect The Shank's judgement, it's a hand way of solving problems without causing too many other issues."
  
  TPM_trevor:0 "Trevor's and Sons'"
  TPM_trevor_advisor_desc:0 ""Deputy" isn't a title Trevor Larkson likes using often, but it is one of the many titles he's acquired over the years. Trevor is one of those figures that does pretty much whatever job he finds there's an opening for, and—while he's not qualified for the majority of jobs he ends up doing—he's somehow managed to avoid disaster thus far. A minister on Sundays, a deputy on Mondays, a trash collector on Tuesdays, and a construction worker on Wednesdays through Saturdays, he and his small family can always be relied upon to pick up any job that needs doing and that nobody else is around or available to do. Lately he's taken up a particular knack for helping the Patrolmen set up roadblocks and forts for dealing with bandits in the Bluff, and all that he needs is a good paycheck and he'll be sure whatever job needs to get done is done before it has any right to be finished."
  
  TPM_mayor:0 "Friendly Guy"
  TPM_mayor_advisor_desc:0 ""Da Mayor" is not, in fact, a mayor. An old, retired patrolman inspired by a lifetime of collecting pre-war movies, Da Mayor now runs the local theater and hosts viewing sessions of recovered holotapes every weekend evening when the majority of the Patrol are back in town for the weekly Patrol Lead meetups. He's made it his life's mission to make sure every good citizen of Lafayette knows just how lucky they are to live in such a clean, healthy city, and whenever a holiday or cause for celebration comes up it's always Da Mayor who ends up doing the planning. Of course, if you knew him particularly well, you'd know Da Mayor is perfectly fine being called by his real name—that just being "Chuck"—but he just thinks it's funnier to lean into an adopted stereotype, so best not."
  
  TPM_callahan_fake:0 "Barman on Particle Row"
  TPM_callahan_fake_advisor_desc:0 "Johnny was a deputy for a few years back when his second cousin Adam signed up, but he rather quickly figured out that life on the move wasn't for him. Sure, camping out in the middle of the forest was fun as a novelty with friends once or twice a year, but as a job description? No thank you. So he took over his dad's bar when he retired, and the bar's been flourishing ever since. Johnny's exactly the type of guy you'd expect to be a bartender. He's both simultaneously a great keeper of secrets and the town's biggest gossip, and the Bar on Particle Row continues to see great success as long as he's at the helm. And hey, as long as the Patrol's appetite for booze matches his own appetite for a good story, a fair bit of Patrolmen paychecks both come through his bar and then end up back in Patrolmen hands in exchange for help escorting choice goods through rough territory. It's a win-win scenario, and even the chief's proud that this humble bartender is helping carry on the good Callahan family name in his own way."
  
  TPM_coolant:0 "Practical Conservationist"
  TPM_coolant_advisor_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Kron Coolant has the unique position of pissing everyone off by reminding folks not to be wasteful in their daily lives. While most of the Patrolmen in Lafayette don't have too much to do with average citizens (except on weekends), Coolant spends a lot of his time convincing people in positions of business or construction of new ways to recycle and reuse materials. If it wasn't for him, there probably wouldn't have been enough bricks to finish the current Lafayette Main Patrol Station before the hurricane hit back in '74, and he makes sure everyone remembers that little tidbit of information whenever they question if they *really* need to take every individual spare scrap of metal and reserve it for use in some vague future building project."
  
  TPM_marshall:0 "Honest Fella"
  TPM_marshall_advisor_desc:0 "Patrol Lead Marshall is one of the few members of the Patrol to have been born in the raider-ridden city of Alexandria, and he's the only one of that small number to have risen to the point of leading his own patrol group. It was the 9th Patrol Group—"Marshall's Madmen"—who held the rear during the retreat out of Alexandria the last time the Patrolmen attacked the Gator Maws back in '69. Though he was initially born and raised into the tribal gang structure of the Gators, he quickly found he was dissatisfied with the savage inconsistency that came with life in Alexandria, and him surrendering himself to a passing patrol seemed like the natural way to get out. He was just as surprised as the Patrolmen when he decided to sign up as a Patrolman himself, and he's long held a secret dream of wanting to return home and help turn Alexandria into a clean, stable city like Lafayette has been for centuries. Maybe he'll get to live that dream, maybe not."
  
  TPM_larry:0 "Weekly Polls"
  TPM_larry_advisor_desc:0 "Larry Lopez was born in 2257 along with his twin brother Bob. After growing up in Lafayette surrounded by Patrolmen going on noble adventures and performing acts of selfless bravery, Larry never had any doubts about what he wanted to do with his life. He signed up for the Young Deputy program at age 16 back in '73, and only recently did he finally get his badge—on the same day his brother also signed up and skipped the Young Deputy program entirely. While Larry's still a bit of a rookie to most of the harder jobs the Patrolmen organization expects of its members, he's a popular extravert among the youth of Lafayette, and he runs weekly bowling tournaments for anyone who wants to show up. Having his fingers in so many pies has allowed him to act as an unofficial PR branch of the Patrol's operations, and his casual polls to test the water of Lafayette public opinion have saved the chief a lot of trouble in avoiding deeply unpopular moves he would've otherwise genuinely considered taking. Unfortunately, taking these polls has also given an outlet for some of the less-than-satisfied residents of the city to voice concerns in a public manner, but eh, Larry's always figured it's just a part of the job."
  
  TPM_bob:0 "Scripture Says"
  TPM_bob_advisor_desc:0 "Bob Lopez was born in 2257 alongside his twin brother Larry. While Larry always knew he wanted to join the Patrolmen, Bob was never so lucky as to have deep convictions about serving with the blue and gold. He did, however, find a deep interest in the theology of the local church, and he finds the most satisfaction in leading a core group of fellow young folks on weekends—some of whom ended up becoming fellow Patrol members when he finally signed up. He joined the Patrolmen and bypassed the rank of Deputy Trainee entirely on the exclusive commendation of Pastor Harper's glowing testimony of Bob's moral character. Bob doesn't want to kill anyone in the course of his service, and he's not sure if he'd have the guts to do so if his job required it of him, but on a philosophical level he knows there's nothing more just than putting one's own life on the line to defend one's home and loved ones, so whenever he's not at church, that's what he's decided he's going to do, and maybe he can help make the Patrolmen a better group of people through his own influence."
  
  TPM_pulp:0 "Certified Troublemaker"
  TPM_pulp_advisor_desc:0 "Deputy Ronald Pulp is widely known to be a very annoying man. He joined the patrol back in '73 for the express purpose of rising through the ranks. He hopes that one day he'll be able to rise all the way to Patrol Chief, so that he'll be able to call the shots in Lafayette and rebuild the city in his own self-absorbed image. But for what he lacks in tact, he makes up for in consistency. Among the generally apolitical citizens of Lafayette, Pulp is a stark reminder why so many normal folks have given up their right to an active political system in favor of just trusting the Patrolmen to do the right thing—it's just so much more relaxing not having more people like Pulp around. When Pulp tries to convince people to dislike the Patrolmen's monopoly on effective governance, he indirectly ends up convincing most people that things are perfectly fine the way they are, and really, the Patrol's administration isn't that bad."
  
  TPM_content:0 "Satisfied"
  
  CALLAHAN_STEEL_DESC:0 "While working for someone else always sounded like the worst case scenario for the Patrolmen's big chief, things haven't turned out quite as bad as they could've been. The chief's still calling the shots in Lafayette, and at the end of the day, as long as the patrols protect our new bosses out west and make sure nothing seriously bad's been goin' on in the Bluff that would concern our noble overlords, things are mostly as they were. With the foreign situation safely tucked away, Callahan's put on a Steel hat to show his allegiance to the bigger boys while still making sure to join the regular patrols. And strangely? The patrol leads closest to him have started makin' out that he's gotten to be a happier person since the whole ordeal went down. Wonder if that'll last."
  TPM_steel_hat_content_leader:0 "Someone Else's Deputy"
  
  CALLAHAN_BLACK_DESC:0 "Having fought a series of wars he'd never imagined the good citizens of Lafayette would have to endure, Patrol Chief Callahan finally had his good-natured optimism beaten down and broken in the jungles of Alexandria. Fed up with cowardice in the ranks and corruption in the leads, he's sent out the word that he's so disappointed in the current state of the Patrol that he's gone and donned the Chief's Black Hat; a symbolic gesture of just anger from a few generations back. With his revolver always loaded and the chief making sure patrols remain responsible towards the citizenry they've sworn to protect and brave against the bandits we've sworn to fight, nobody ever really knows when the chief'll show up, and his word is the law of the land. On the bounce, lawman—we've got bandits to catch."
  TPM_black_hat_disgruntled_leader:0 "Disgruntled"
  
  CALLAHAN_BLUE_DESC:0 "Patrol Chief Callahan was born to be a Patrolman; the only child of the former Patrol Chief and a field hospital nurse, he grew up watching his parents delivering justice and healing the sick of their own free will. Despite rising normally through the ranks before his election to Patrol Chief twenty four years ago, he's only just picking up on the rapidly decaying foundations holding the Tenth Patrolmen together. His father's policies of self reporting and individual responsibility have lead to a rise in corrupt officials, an increased raider presence, and extensive abuse of the sense of righteous duty in an organisation many once trusted. For as much as he's wanted to keep things the way they were in his father's day, Callahan is finally beginning to catch on to the idea that perhaps the Gold and Blue might not mean what it used to in the Wasteland."

  TPM_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Since we got slapped around a bit by the bigger boys out west, Lafayette's been reorganized into a community council of the finest folks in town. But none of these guys have any aptitude for governance whatsoever and they've got no interest in screwing up their lives by gettin' political, so at the end of the day half the folks on the council turn to Callahan (now retired) for advice and the other half flounder around and don't do much of anything. The end result of this is a system that is perfectly attuned to get nothing done. Maybe someday they'll drop the pretence and just put Callahan back in charge where the guy belongs, but if this experiment's shown one thing about the good citizens of Lafayette, it's that they just aren't ready to live without the Patrol. At least the bigger boys out west haven't been getting much out of them either, given how incompetent they've turned out to be."
