 tpm_frequently_raided_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts to keep the Patrolmen's influence known on the countryside, we're still chosen as a raiding target quite often, and Lafayette has to bail out the Bluff from bandit attacks every other month or so. If we had to guess why, it's probably down to those bastard mobsters out of New Orleans taking a cut of expeditions made in our land, but we can't prove anything other than that they always come from up by Alexandria and they always make their getaways in skiffs out by The Cannery. Hopefully we'll figure out how to put an end to these raids someday, but for now? Guess we just gotta keep on keepin' on."

 tpm_rest_stop_desc:0 " In our early post-war history, Lafayette proved to be a surprisingly stable town amidst a sea of chaos. While most other cities that got nuked withered away or just barely clung on and a fair few cities that were spared destruction fell to starvation or savagery regardless due to a breakdown of American supply lines, Lafayette hung on and rebuilt peacefully after it got bombed. Even when the bandits started heading our way, they came in few enough numbers that even the average citizen could feel consistently safe in their own homes. Times are changing, of course, but it's a point of pride that we were never in too much danger, and we're known across the marshes of Louisiana as a safe haven you can move to if you want to retire."

While most other cities that got nuked withered away or just barely clung on and a fair few cities that were spared destruction fell to starvation or savagery regardless due to a breakdown of American supply lines, Lafayette hung on and rebuilt peacefully after it got bombed. But that didn't last forever, and not too long after our distant ancestors reclaimed the city center did the raiders launch their attacks. We created the First Lafayette Patrolmen as a response to that threat, and they did an excellent job repelling the attacks. After a few civic crises the Patrol rebranded to the Second Lafayette Patrolmen, and the pattern of renaming the Patrol's organizational name went on until where we are now with the 10th. It wasn't easy, keeping hordes of raiders at bay every few years, but the good people of Lafayette were up to the task."

But that didn't last forever, and not too long after our distant ancestors reclaimed the city center did the raiders launch their attacks. While the good people of Lafayette were trying to get their act together forming the First Lafayette Patrolmen, the raider attacks grew ever more bold. In one tragic night, the small night watch that defended Lafayette got overpowered, and raiders flooded past our improvised barricades and into the park at the center of the city, with their leader at the head of their columns. But one man (who would later become the first Patrol Chief) met the entire group of raiders there and challenged their leader to single combat, with the raider being allowed to use a knife and our guy only using his bare hands. Winner had to have his group leave the city and never return. Our guy won, of course. The raiders didn't honor their former boss's word, of course. Our guy was just buying time for our citizens to regroup, of course. And our guys had dynamite, of course. A lot of good men died that day, but we won our freedom and learned from that mistake, forming the Gold and Blue as a direct response."

Things have mostly been kept to reasonable levels, but every now and then the chief hears word of some member of the Patrol group or another going out of their way to charge ludicrous fees for protection, followed up by rumors of trouble being made for the individual if they refused to pay up. These rumors are mostly just that—rumors—but it's still enough to set the chief on edge and the citizens of Lafayette are starting to take notice."

Another significant part of our job has been preemptively fighting crime in the dense forests of the nearby town of Moss Bluff. We've done a moderately good job of it, but every now and then the chief gets wind of some bandit found dead by a Patrolman's gun that wasn't formally reported up the chain to the rest of the Patrol, and combining that with rumors of unnecessary extortion from other aspects of the Patrol, the chief is starting to get worried. If folks can't trust the gold and blue, who can they trust?"

And unfortunately, that's just not what we're doing anymore. Most of the upper echelons of the Patrolmen organization have gone through the motions to the point of apathy, and most of the new hires on the ground only signed up to make a quick buck or to get a free gun. Things are going south, and it's the point of greatest shame for the chief that the few honest folks in every Patrol group other than the 5th (who pledge their sole loyalty to the chief) had to bring in these rumors anonymously for fear of peer reprisals. It's a grim situation, and everyone knows it, even the local free-roaming bandits and the extortionist fake Patrolmen that show up every now and then."

We've had a lot more time and energy to focus on refining our troops' fighting abilities now that we don't have to worry about the domestic situation, and all things considered, Callahan's found it surprisingly easy to work with our new masters. Just a "yes sir" here, a "no ma'am" there, and a "on it" every couple weeks and they mostly leave us to our devices. It definitely could be worse."
 
 tpm_lament:0 "Louisiana's Lament"
 tpm_lament_desc:0 "Lafayette isn't meant to be a puppet state, serving some foreign master. The Patrolmen organization formed to protect ourselves from the very fate of subjugation that we now find ourselves in. It'll require causing a bit of trouble on the home front, but even the chief knows we'd be better off being troublemakers fighting a long and subtle fight for independence than the current servants of a foreign order we've been reduced to. Our job is to uphold the law, and the law of the land says there ain't gonna be nobody rulin' over Lafayette other than the good citizens of Lafayette themselves."

 tpm_next_generations_desc:0 "Look. Personally, we've got nothing against mutants. Most mutants around these parts are rather swell fellas, minus the pirates. We get a few savages wandering past from out east every couple decades and there's a few problems with angry Texan mutants starting heated arguments over a bar tab or something petty every couple years, sure, but those aren't big problems. But for the time being, the chief's made the executive decision that we should probably keep mutants off the Patrol. It's not that they wouldn't be handy to have around, it's just that the Patrol is a local group specifically there to help Lafayette help itself, and really, there's only a couple mutants who live in Lafayette full-time and they've made it clear they couldn't care less about the Patrol. Maybe this policy'll change someday, but for now, let's keep the ranks in a clean uniform. Best not divide things more than they already are."
 
 tpm_civility:0 "The Civility of Lafayette"
 tpm_civility_desc:0 "Something we figured out rather quickly after the whole incident over in Libercity a couple decades back was that Lafayette is a very unique city. We alone among all our neighbors managed to really keep together after the bombs dropped, and our Patrolmen have made sure that we have a uniquely safe and civilized corner of the "Wasteland" to call our own. When people come to Lafayette looking for trouble, we turn 'em back where they came from, and that's usually that. While even the chief knows there's quite a few problems with encouraging folks to be hostile to outsiders, nobody's denying that Lafayette's civility is something we'd really rather preserve at almost any cost. It's our home, after all."

We alone managed to keep things together when the rest of the "Wasteland" fell apart, and many of our folks feel that it's our duty to help out others when we can. Of course, the whole mess with cannibals in Texas is finally winding down, but we've got a long history of fighting bandits in the general vicinity of our neighborhood, and as much as many of our folks hate to admit it, sometimes Texas counts as our neighborhood. It's a satisfying thing, being someone's nicer neighbor."

So he's sent out the word—anyone who shot a bandit and didn't report it, took too much cash from a local and pocketted the change, or anything else on a long list of "corrupt acts" can get an official Patrolmen Pardon if they report it now. Not everyone trusts the chief and there's been a lot of uneasiness in the wake of the announcement, but the chief showing he's putting his boys before anyone else in Louisiana is a good look, at least for us. We'll see if he keeps up the favoritism or if this is just a one-off thing."

He's sent out a notice to every badge in the Patrol relaying his disappointment with how we've been taking too much cash from the people we're supposed to be protecting—called us "Bandits in Blue," he did. He said from this moment on, anyone caught charging more cash than we're supposed to charge for the Patrolmen's civil upkeep fees will lose their badge on the spot. What he didn't make note of, however, was the other major issue of many Patrolmen recruits being too trigger-happy and too willing to escalate their use of force in the Patrol at large, so—while we're gonna go around feel a bit more self-righteous about ourselves for a while, that's not gonna stop our more dastardly members from taking their newfound respect as a license to kill."

He's sent out a notice to every badge in the Patrol relaying his disappointment with how we've been too quick to shoot in a wide variety of circumstances, ranging from using deadly force without warning against surrounded bandit camps to addressing rumors of some of the more troublesome of our boys even putting bullets in bandits who'd clearly already surrendered. What he didn't address, however, was the chronic uptick in civil upkeep fees some of our boys have been collecting from our most loyal citizens, and the failure of the chief's office to deal with that topic has left a bit of a bad taste in some of our citizen's mouths. We'll have to wait and see how it all pans out."

He's sent out a notice to every badge in the Patrol relaying his disappointment with how we've been charging too much for "protection," how we've been too quick to shoot bandits without giving them fair chances to surrender, and how we've generally just gotten too big for our badges. He's also made clear he's putting a few of our Patrol Leads into the explicit task of keeping an eye on us to stop that kinda behavior in the future. It's a rapidly-evolving situation on the ground and a fair few of our finest have already been stripped of their badges, but usually fair evidence has been provided in these cases. We'll have to see how it turns out, but it seems the chief has finally cracked, and the age of the casual Callahan is coming to an end."

He took special note of the fact that the Lawkeeper model has always served Lafayette well, and there's something uniquely special about having our patrols consist of nothing but normal boys with boots on the ground. As such, he's doubling down on the Patrolmen's traditional model of combat with regards to how we're gonna be running actual extensive combat missions and foreign "wars." Nobody's really sure what he means by "wars," but for all intents and purposes we're hoping nothing changes other than that he figures out some new strategies to use with the Blue and Gold's best."

We haven't exactly been the most motorized city in Louisiana for the last couple hundred years, but the vast majority of the Patrol's higher ups have Jeeps or Pickups to get around in, and a few of them have even trained with combat methods specifically using those family vehicles to run bandits down. If we embraced this little style of carnage in combat, we could make the entire Patrol a more mobile fighting force capable of taking the fight to anyone in driving distance. Maybe we should give it a try and invest some resources into the idea."

With the rapid expansion of the Texan Brotherhood, we've been taking on a handful of new recruits from the Lone Star State, and a fair few of them have prior experience with the now-defunct Texan Rangers. Like with most ex-American ranger groups, they trained in much the same way we do with long wasteland patrols, but they practice a much harder style of life with far more discipline than our boys have. The Patrolmen could use a few good men like that; a hammer to use against the greater Patrol's anvil. Taking some time to invest in specialized body armor and small amounts of power armor could help greatly with solving our issues of organizational casual-ness, and it'd give the Patrol some much-needed teeth."

We're not a Texan group and we've got nothing against Texas or the ideals of the fine folks living there, but despite the obvious lack of reason for conflict, Texas has gone out of their way to make us enemy #1 on their lists. We're not gonna forget that insult. Our job is to hunt bandits, and someone who tries to steal someone else's land for no reason other than that he wants the land is a bandit. Granted, these bandits are tough, but so are we. Let's show the bastards what happens when you cross the good citizens of Lafayette."

And what'd they say? Nothing. The bastards spat in our face. So the chief's sent out the word—it's time to stop pretending. Louisiana might not be the prettiest place and there's a lotta bandits of every flavor running rampant throughout the region, but man, it's our home, and we're not gonna let some tin cans—or anyone else, for that matter—take it from us. We're gonna march on Dallas and show 'em how real lawkeeping works. That being, of course, at the end of a revolver."

In doing so, he's made clear he has no interest in taking on the mess that is Texas. Lafayette has always been and ought always to be the main focus of our patrols, and that's how it's going to stay.

We have lawmen to uphold the laws, sure, but at the end of the day there isn't really a set of organized laws that Lafayette runs by, and we've always been able to get along despite that because no disagreements ever spiral too far out of control and the few times that has happened either someone ends up leaving the city or a duel happens and one guy's argument is suddenly made irrelevant. And frankly? We've had a good, long think about it, and we don't really see any reason this should change. Lafayette's a respectable city, and the men it's put on the Patrolmen organization are generally respectable folks. It's not that we have some deep ideological grudge against a proper code of laws, it's just that it seems like a lot of effort just to codify the common sense we already operate under.

Callahan's put some of the brightest heads in the city together to scratch out an improvised code of laws to help solve disputes, and we've made sure the most commonly-visited folks in the city for solving disputes have a copy of each of these new "Lafayette Lawbooks," as the chief's taken to calling 'em.

It was only a couple years in that a recently-ghoulified biker gang took the place over, and it's been Texas's main garage city for the last two centuries. Sucks that those bikers had to turn raider after a few years of boredom, but now that we've shown 'em their raiding days are over, most of them are willing to get back to being useful, respectable members of a normal society.
