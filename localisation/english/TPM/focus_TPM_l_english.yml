 tpm_minutes_of_madness:0 "Minutes of Madness"
 tpm_minutes_of_madness_desc:0 "When the bombs dropped roughly two centuries ago, parish sheriff Alexander Callahan was just making his way into his home city of Lafayette. He ended up spending the next few terrible weeks picking up the shattered pieces of his life, doing his best to keep law and order in the blackened and radioactive remnants of his home. Why did a nuclear bomb fall on the explicitly civilian target of Lafayette, of all places? Nobody knows."
 tpm_town_life:0 "Small Town Life"
 tpm_town_life_desc:0 "As the decades went by, the small refugee town that had been built on the outskirts of the city of Lafayette started to creep inwards. After nearly half a century of exile, a handful of settlers with a vague background in forgotten sciences declared the city center must be safe for habitation once more. Our ancestors picked through the charred bones of their ancestors, but eventually things got back to something vaguely resembling normal. Life goes on."
 tpm_the_bluff:0 "The Scouring of the Bluff"
 tpm_the_bluff_desc:0 "After a suspiciously long period of normal post-war innocence allowing Lafayette to rebuild itself, the first of many bandit gangs attacked the city en masse in 2113, originating from a hideout in the overgrown forest surrounding the town of Moss Bluff. Some people got killed, but the good citizens of Lafayette rallied and formed a group of trusted law enforcement professionals to hunt down the bandits. And hunt them down they did."
 tpm_gold_and_blue:0 "The Gold and Blue"
 tpm_gold_and_blue_desc:0 "Since the formation of the Lafayette Patrolmen back in 2143, a lot has changed, and a lot has stayed the same. We never really got ambitious about our position, with most of our citizens prefering to keep to the city limits and live their lives in peace. They trust the Patrols to protect them, and the Patrol has been given a level of lattitude with regards to law enforcement that borders on corruption. Not that you'd be welcome to say it is, as that might get you laid low like the bandit you probably are."
 tpm_trade_orleans:0 "Trade with New Orleans"
 tpm_trade_orleans_desc:0 "New Orleans... What a city. It's amazing how a place can have such great music and such nice citizens and be so completely overrun with organized banditry that just wandering the streets after dark is likely to cost you your wallet. Well, some of our less morally-burdened merchants have struck a deal with the Orleans mob to get our hands on some of their fancier guns for a cheap price, so hey. Everyone's gotta deal with the devil sooner or later."
 tpm_pirate_report:0 "Pirate's Report"
 tpm_pirate_report_desc:0 "Looks like our brief foray into the Orleans underworld attracted some attention. And somehow, it wasn't the bad kind. Our merchants just struck a deal with some shady pirate-types from down in the Caribbean to keep an eye out for anything that might concern Lafayette going forward. We doubt this'll realistically amount to much in the grand scheme of things, but who knows? Maybe having an extra private eye without moral qualms might be the ace up our sleeve we needed."
 tpm_trade_memphis:0 "Trade with Memphis"
 tpm_trade_memphis_desc:0 "Memphis is a weird, weird city. Least, that's based on every account we've heard of the place. Got some freak show circus running the place with a bunch of cult stuff on every block of the place. Robed fashion and all that—nothing like most of the more normal places surrounding it. But for all they lack in coherent life, we've gotta admit they're not half bad at striking a bargain with the right people. A handful of caps and we've got some eastern slaves to turn loose as new citizens and some trinkets to justify the whole ordeal. Not bad."
 tpm_skybound_designs:0 "Skybound Designs"
 tpm_skybound_designs_desc:0 "Another one of those weirdos from Memphis showed up today with a backpack full of old world fighter blueprints. We're not sure where he picked up a list of designs this old, but he's willing to part with the whole package for a fairly moderate price. Who knows, maybe having a few planes lying around could come in handy someday?"
 tpm_reinforce_legends:0 "Reinforce the Legends"
 tpm_reinforce_legends_desc:0 "Gather 'round the campfire! Every year or so, the Patrol Chief likes to gather every man in the patrol (minus a skeleton crew to guard the city limits) to the city center to exchange stories. It's not some big, fancy meeting with a podium and speakers and all that—just a wide, open space with a few dozen fires for a few dozen groups of a few dozen people to group up and talk shop for a bit. Let's open up with a recent one. Y'all heard about that mutant pirate?"
 tpm_cunningham_adventure:0 "Cunningham's Adventure"
 tpm_cunningham_adventure_desc:0 "It's one of the Patrol's greatest points of shame that we weren't able to hold the city of Alexandria for any significant length of time after we seized the place back in 2243, but before the Gator Maws game roaring back into their old home we really messed the place up! The bastards had all sorts of weird and cruel stuff goin' on, and we probably saved hundreds of lives just by goin' in when we did. Sweet justice!"
 tpm_george_adventure:0 "George's Adventure"
 tpm_george_adventure_desc:0 "Some of the folks in the Patrolmen have been around for a fair few more winters than our younger members, and boy, do they have stories to tell. Sheriff George here took part in the Battle of Libercity, that time we humiliated the Rockets by doing their job for them. Bandits don't know borders, but for a price, neither can we. What an adventure!"
 tpm_chiefs_contribution:0 "The Chief's Contribution"
 tpm_chiefs_contribution_desc:0 "Callahan's not exactly a rookie to the service, but he ain't exactly a sage either. He got the title of chief directly from his big daddy, Old Man Callahan. That man was a legend, and our current chief earned his badge in that whole mess outside New Orleans... What was it, seven years back? Losin' track of time. Maybe the chief would be better to explain this one."
 tpm_best_policy:0 "The Best Policy"
 tpm_best_policy_desc:0 "Fact of the matter is the patrol ain't what it used to be. Leastwise, that's what the chief keeps muttering to himself, and it's startin' to rub off on the boys a bit. He's called a proper meeting of the patrol leads to get to the bottom of some of the issues he's been picking up on, and to be honest, nobody's really sure what to expect. I mean, I dunno what he's seeing, but things are goin' alright, ain't they?"
 tpm_open_streets:0 "On the Open Streets"
 tpm_open_streets_desc:0 "Callahan's been goin' mad! At least, that's the word on the street, but nobody'd dare say it to the guy's face. He's the Patrol Chief, after all. Still, he's been goin' around finding some of our lads seemingly at random and taking their badges from them right then and there. Maybe he's got a reason, but if he does, he ain't exactly publishing it in"
 tpm_never_meet_heroes:0 "Never Meet Your Heroes"
 tpm_never_meet_heroes_desc:0 "Turns out half the reason Callahan's been dumping some of our less productive patrol members has to do with cutting costs. Fair enough on that—he's taking the freed up funds and heading over to Dynamite Danny's to stock up on heavy weaponry! Man, we've been needing some of the fun stuff. Not for any real reason, we just wanna try it."
 tpm_to_the_bottom:0 "To the Bottom of It"
 tpm_to_the_bottom_desc:0 "Callahan's called two of our favorite practical jokers into his office for a meetup. Said somethin' about them goin' too far. Not quite sure what he means by that, but Kim and Tim Hardy are nearly pissin' their pants with fright over the whole issue. Hopefully they've got the right words to say to the chief."
 tpm_callahan_revenge:0 "Callahan's Revenge"
 tpm_callahan_revenge_desc:0 "Now that the chief's done making the rounds with the Patrol, he's called everyone together for a meetup. We all know what this is probably about—there's been a new wave of rumors floating about that the Cannery's keeping some of our boys as slaves that raid up on Alexandria a few years back. Some are sayin' the chief's decided he wants to give that raid another shot and teach the Motors a lesson about takin' in slaves. And frankly? Most of the boys probably wouldn't object to that plan."
 tpm_maw_wargoal:0 "Raiders to the North of Me"
 tpm_maw_wargoal_desc:0 "We thought we punished the Gator gangs hard enough that they'd stick to their own clay after that raid back in '43, but they've got a new leader and they're PISSED. That Sobek girl they've gone and put in charge of their band of bandits is causin' mayhem for anyone travelling through those swamps, and Alexandria's turned into a raider fortress we can't ignore. Gather the full Patrol—it's time to shoot some gators!"
 tpm_maw_aftermath:0 "Here I Am"
 tpm_maw_aftermath_desc:0 "One big part of the Second Battle of Alexandria (as the Chief's taken to callin' it) ended up being just how quick he was with his revolver. More than a few times the Chief saved one of our boys' lives just by bein' in the right place at the right time, with just the right number of bullets sittin' in their respective chambers. Now that we've got a tight grip on the place, let's use it to get some better materials for our revolvers and figure out some training ideas to boot. Gotta be quick as the chief if you're gonna make it out alive."
 tpm_maw_side:0 "Sobek's Station"
 tpm_maw_side_desc:0 "Sobek's throne in the heart of Alexandria's suburbs is a bloody thing. She's got butchered corpses hangin' from meat hooks and all that disgusting stuff you see in pre-war horror flicks. She ended up dyin' in that big last stand of hers, and we're pretty sure the Chief was the one that nailed her right between the eyes. He's feelin' awful bad about killin' a kid young as she was, but we think he knows he did the right thing."
 tpm_maw_core:0 "Dismantle the Chains"
 tpm_maw_core_desc:0 "Just a few good patrols later and Alexandria's startin' to look like a normal town again. We've got settlers comin' up from Lafayette and the Lawmen are doin' a good job of makin' sure all the normal citizens who've been living in terror under the Gators know they're safe now. We did a good thing, here, and it feels like people can finally move safely through Alexandria's swamps once again."
 tpm_bayou_wargoal:0 "Slavers to the South"
 tpm_bayou_wargoal_desc:0 "'Cordin' to some reports one of our boys brought in on the Motors a few weeks back, he swears up and down he saw Ol' Patrol Lead Jenkins walkin' around the Cannery in chains doin' slave labor. We tried to confirm that report, but somethin' weird's goin' on on that island and we can't get anywhere near it without gettin' shot at. We'd say that's a guilty admission if we've ever heard one. Let's get our boys back and break some chains!"
 tpm_bayou_aftermath:0 "Stuck in the Middle"
 tpm_bayou_aftermath_desc:0 "Stormin' the Cannery wasn't exactly an easy task. Place is on an island with one crossing that's only really there depending on the tides. Real messy battle, but we got it in the end 'cause the Chief made sure he was in the planning room pointing out what trees were safe to hide behind and where we shouldn't shoot 'cause that'd damage the canning operation. Callahan's a strict chief, but he's got the right idea, and now we're the ones canning fish for the northern gulf."
 tpm_bayou_side:0 "Resting Rumors"
 tpm_bayou_side_desc:0 "So, uh... Well. \n After talkin' to a bunch of people for a long time, we're pretty sure there, uh... Um...  \n Well, we think there might've been some sorta misunderstanding about the whole "slaves" thing. Maybe."
 tpm_bayou_core:0 "Patrol the Waves"
 tpm_bayou_core_desc:0 "Stupid as that whole fight might've been, fact remains Lafayette's Lawmen are the new big dog running the Cannery, and it's probably gonna stick that way. After we got around to figurin' out the whole "slaves" thing that made us fight in the first place, most other issues went out the window. 'Course, there's still a bit of a bitter feeling from the locals 'bout what we did, but we'll protect them and they can get about their business. We've got patrols to make."
 tpm_tough_crowd:0 "With This Tough Crowd"
 tpm_tough_crowd_desc:0 "With our two more problematic neighbors properly sorted out, Chief Callahan's got just enough time on his hands to start payin' attention to how things're goin' on around our humble city. Turns out, things aren't goin' great, and there's a monster droolin' over Louisiana that we've gotta be quick if we wanna not end up in a proper war with. Let's hope the Chief's up to the task."
 tpm_elders_treachery:0 "The Elder's Treachery"
 tpm_elders_treachery_desc:0 "That rusty rat Rusk! We'd hoped we could strike some kinda bargain with him and his bumblin' brotherhood, but he's gone and attacked us with our backs turned to 'im! Well, we're not the only boys in this corner o' the south who can pack a mean punch, and man, if Rusk ain't the guy that deserves a good punch right now, I dunno who is."
 tpm_i_love_this_focus_name:0 "This is Stupid"
 tpm_i_love_this_focus_name_desc:0 "Man, who here really wanted a war with Texas? I mean, what've they ever done to us, and what've we ever done to them? All they wanna do is take our stuff, and that makes 'em no better than bandits. We're gonna need a bit of time to get our boys up to scratch to deal with their armor, though. Let's just put up some barricades and see if we can hold what we've got for a bit before we try anything fancy."
 tpm_obvious_tactic:0 "The Obvious Tacic"
 tpm_obvious_tactic_desc:0 "The Brotherhood outa Dallas seems to all have the same thing in common—every last one o'them buggers is either wearing power armor or has a guy in armor right behind him. Sucks that that armor's immune to most of our small arms fire, and it double sucks that most of our guns count as small arms. Maybe we could get some bigger guns to punch 'em to pieces? Dynamite Danny's got us covered, for a price."
 tpm_ALL_YOU_HAD_TO_DO:0 "Darnit, We're Heroes!" #WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN
 tpm_ALL_YOU_HAD_TO_DO_desc:0 "Rusk's been at our gates for a while now, but we've shown we aren't afraid of him and his big tin bullies. But realistically, it'd be an awful lotta trouble to go take Dallas out from under 'em. Maybe the Chief can try to talk 'em down one more time, now that we've got things secure enough to give 'em time to think?"
 tpm_the_dallas_meetup:0 "A Drive to Dallas" #in and out am i right
 tpm_the_dallas_meetup_desc:0 "Callahan's decided to take a road trip to the old city of Dallas personally. He'll be back in a few days, but basically he's gonna have a chat with that Rusk fellow who's on the warpath over in Texas and startin' to look our way. We're hopin' he can be persuaded to have us as junior partners in his growin' sphere of influence, but if not, we might just have a fight on our hands." #riiiight
 tpm_proving_worth:0 "Proving our Worth"
 tpm_proving_worth_desc:0 "Well, we sure dodged a bullet with that one. The Brotherhood's made the call to let us be friends for the time bein', and it only seems right we make a show of proving we're worthy enough to be called friends in their eyes. Check this—let's get a bunch of our patrols and a bunch of their knights out and have a picnic or somethin'! We can do some joint patrols afterwards, as a treat. Sounds like a right splendid time for all."
 tpm_armored_scouts:0 "Armored Scouts?"
 tpm_armored_scouts_desc:0 "Man, that power armor the Brotherhood's got is just some of the neatest stuff around. One thing Callahan asked about after he and Rusk made their deal was gettin' our boys some of that armor. Rusk said he'd probably get shot dead on the spot if he gave us the blueprints without gettin' to know us a bit better first, but he slipped us some papers that oughta help us get started on makin' some fancier types of armor, if we wanted to try that."
 tpm_howdy_pardner:0 "Partners and Friends"
 tpm_howdy_pardner_desc:0 "The Economic Union's got a buncha different groups in it by this point, but the three big'uns are Dallas, Lone Star, and Austin. We've been gettin' a buncha tourists comin' in from each of 'em, and some of our boys are startin' to form opinions about some of the cities just based on who they've been sendin' our way. Fun stuff!"
 tpm_saints_and_sinners:0 "Peace in the Swamps"
 tpm_saints_and_sinners_desc:0 "Well, thank God that's all over. What a mess. Texas ain't gonna threaten Lafayette any longer, and we've only gone and put a stone in Goliath's forehead to do it. This is why we patrol—to keep our home safe, and to make sure we get to keep on patrollin' 'till the sun don't shine no more!"
 tpm_blackpeople_belike:0 "Donning the Black Hat"
 tpm_blackpeople_belike_desc:0 "Uh oh. \n One o'the old traditions the Patrol Chiefs have got goin' for the last century or so is whenever things got out of control they'd take off their normal blue hats and throw a big black disc up top. Callahan's just taken out his great grandaddy's old black hat, and he's makin' a big stink about just how wrong somethin' with the patrol's income is. What are we, bankers?"
 tpm_determined_defenders:0 "Determined Defenders"
 tpm_determined_defenders_desc:0 "Huntsville's a nice town in the Brotherhood's area a little ways east of Austin. Shame we had to get it so messed up. Callahan got word the other day that a gang a'mutant raiders was causin' havoc in the town and the Brotherhood was too busy to deal with it. The Chief was in a bad mood as it was—he packed up three patrols and drove directly to the place. We're pretty sure he got all the bandits, but we lost a few of our own guys and a few more quit after seein' just how angry the Chief could get when some of our softer lads kept not wantin' to shoot."
 tpm_steelhand_siege:0 "Steelhand's Siege"
 tpm_steelhand_siege_desc:0 "Slappy Steelhand's one of the biggest bandit names in the Bluff. Somehow he'd managed to dodge our patrols in a single town for over 20 years, runnin' the Bluff as if the whole place was his own little fief. But Callahan's rage finally pinned the bastard to a concrete wall last night, and after an all-night siege we managed to take the bandit king out. That's one small step for law and order that we needed right about now."
 tpm_gunslingers_galore:0 "Gunslingers Galore"
 tpm_gunslingers_galore_desc:0 "It's both a problem and a blessing that Texas was filled with Brotherhood lawmen before we signed on with patrolling the place. Positives? Good gear and good training ready all around at a moment's notice. Negatives? They're a buncha roudy bastards with no self control and no sense of respect. Callahan's been taking note, and extracting concessions whenever possible, but more than a few o'Texas's lawmen have wandered onto our turf and got themselves killed in silly duels o'er nothin'."
 tpm_texan_attitude:0 "The Texan Attitude"
 tpm_texan_attitude_desc:0 "Granbury's another little town just west o'Fort Worth. Not really anythin' too special. Least, not until Callahan just so happened to be in town with a patrol at the same time a bank heist was goin' down. The patrol leaped into action and right into a seperatist ambush. Bastards gunned down a good few dozen of our boys before we got the upper hand, but we saved the day and will be makin' good use of some of their gear goin' forward."
 tpm_dismay_in_dallas:0 "Dismay in Dallas"
 tpm_dismay_in_dallas_desc:0 "There's not really a right way to describe just how big a city Dallas really is. You forget there's a place outside the city, what with how much of the place is concrete and asphalt. Granted, there's a buncha random craters here or there where the nukes hit two centuries back, but man. The locals aren't exactly fans of us, but realistically we ain't that different from the Brotherhood, so Callahan's been talkin' to a few prominent locals to smooth things over. Let's hope it worked."
 tpm_cho_bang_is_a_racist_lmao:0 "Cynicism in Lone Star"
 tpm_cho_bang_is_a_racist_lmao_desc:0 "Lone Star's one of those cities that just doesn't care about anythin' but money. They're pissed we took the place over, of course—who wouldn't be if it was Lafayette that lost?—but as long as they're still rich, they don't actually care. Let's slip a few extra caps in some of the right pockets and maybe it'll get some of their more annoying noises to quiet down a bit."
 tpm_rusks_request:0 "Rusk's Request"
 tpm_rusks_request_desc:0 "Old Elder Rusk's been seen wanderin' around Lafayette a little bit recently. Nobody's exactly sure what he's doin' here, but his visit's timed weirdly nice with a few reports outa Dallas about some of our boys stirrin' up trouble. Let's hope whatever they've gotta talk about ain't gonna hurt our lads."

 tpm_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that things've calmed down for a bit, let's take the time to really kick the Cannery's machines into gear. After all, who in all o'Texas wouldn't want fresh fish brought directly in from the coast? Wait, whaddya mean it's 110° outside even at night in Dallas?"
 tpm_iron_exodus:0 "Iron Exodus"
 tpm_iron_exodus_desc:0 "Since the Brotherhood's been pullin' out of Texas at large, a fair few of our lads who came onto our soil from the Brotherhood have decided now's the time to pull up their roots and move back west. Good riddance, we say—half those guys were probably bandits and the other half were just technogibbering morons who couldn't stand a patrol without their precious air conditioned suits."

 tpm_texan_roulette_desc:0 "Now that all's said and done, Patrol Chief Callahan's finally had a little bit of time to put his feet up and think about what comes next. He's gettin' tired, but we all know the Lawmen have gotten better under him. Bribes are at record lows, most of our boys are proud to serve, and a good number of 'em aren't even afraid of death anymore.

Still, it feels good to do somethin' a bit more permanent than just a treehouse in the middle of an empty forest." #im serious, and i know its such a petty and small thing but its bugging the crap outta me

It got abandoned pretty quick when one of our patrols started shootin' their guns in the air and its crew fled overboard and swam to a smaller boat off the shore flyin' the jolly roger, so as far as we're concerned the boat's fair game, but we should probably figure somethin' out before the water bandits get it in their heads to come on back.

He's put together a task force of some of our best and brightest to take the fight to Orleans and show them sonsagators just how strong we've turned out to be on our own two feet over the last few years. Corruption ends today."
 tpm_ilove_democracy:0 "Our Own Town Hall Democracy"
 tpm_ilove_democracy_desc:0 "With the whole corruption issue finally sorted out and Texas bein' the big protector the Chief's been hopin' for, Callahan's decided the time's come to really get the good people'o Lafayette into the act of governance. It's gonna be a rough start, since they're so not used to havin' any kinda control, over themselves, but everyone's gotta start somewhere. Let's hold a mayoral election and see who wins!"
 tpm_patrolling_is_service:0 "Patrolling is Service"
 tpm_patrolling_is_service_desc:0 "Since we settled our differences with the Brotherhood, they've turned out to be relatively nice folks at heart. They're moving away from their roots and really going native, which is both a relief and a fascination to watch. Curiously, given how native they're going, a small handful of their number have decided to quit the Brotherhood outright and head east to sign up with us on the frontier of their sphere of influence. We'll be glad to have 'em!"
 tpm_investment_opportunities:0 "Investment Opportunities"
 tpm_investment_opportunities_desc:0 "Lone Star pretty much runs the economics of Texas, with Howitzer's estate being the only real rival to their influence. Now that we've joined up with Lone Star's political sphere, we've been getting a lot of offers from some of their wealthier businessmen about expanding operations in various aspects of our city's life. Let's put those investments to good use!"
 tpm_good_soldiers:0 "Boss's Orders"
 tpm_good_soldiers_desc:0 "Orders straight from the Patrol Chief himself—if we see any Brotherhood-lookin' folks wandering aimlessly, we're to formally invite 'em over for lunch! It's a fairly small and half-joking order, but given it's an order that gives any and every patrolman an excuse to take a break while still on duty, it's an edict that'll probably get followed to the letter. Let's make the suits feel welcome, and take things a bit easier ourselves while we're at it."
 tpm_nobody_needs_to_know:0 "Nobody Needs to Know"
 tpm_nobody_needs_to_know_desc:0 "Rumor's been goin' around one of our lads shot a paladin dead in the Efrafa Bar out by our border with the Rockets. Why? Guy thought the tin can cheated him in a poker game. That's it. Obviously Callahan's summoned the guy for a meeting, and some of the boys out back are taking bets on whether it's gonna be two or one man leaving that office after the fact."
 tpm_what_it_is:0 "What It Is"
 tpm_what_it_is_desc:0 "While the good citizens of Lafayette don't particularly care one way or the other that we've been reduced to a mere pawn in Texas's grand game, the Lawmen ain't forgettin' the level of freedom they once had. Gone are the days of romance and free patrols, of fighting bandits and making sure the law of the land got upheld at every turn. Callahan's got mixed opinions on the matter, but at the end of the day, where our future lies will always lie with the chief."
 tpm_keats_buddy_pal_chum:0 "Friends in Green"
 tpm_keats_buddy_pal_chum_desc:0 "Austin's super mutants have proven to be a surprisingly generous source of friends. Most of our folks haven't ever seen a mutant—let alone fought one—but the few among our patrols who've gotten wires crossed with mutants and lived to tell the tell won't ever shut up about their experiences. Maybe now that we can see the Texan brand of mutant seems to be a bunch of big softies, maybe those stereotypes will stop getting played up as much."
 tpm_river_patrols:0 "River Patrols"
 tpm_river_patrols_desc:0 "Lafayette's not exactly a seagoing city of sailors, but cross-contamination with Austin's culture is slowly shifting us towards that idea. If you've got a river nearby and wood to build boats with, why not take up a life of sailing the open seas? It's a far more free life than the rapidly-civilizing Texan countryside we're having to learn to live with, and there's plenty of bandits in the nearby gulf to go hunt if we need more adventures."
 tpm_heavier_industry:0 "Heavier Industry"
 tpm_heavier_industry_desc:0 "While this was a pretty obvious consequence in retrospect, signing on with Austin's alliance meant a sudden influx of mutants curious to see how we've been living out in in Louisiana. Some of them have decided to stick around and become honest citizens of Lafayette, and their physical strength have made them excellent builders. Industry's booming with these big guys around!"
 tpm_railroad:0 "The Austin-Cannery Rail Line"
 tpm_railroad_desc:0 "One of Austin's few requests with regards to how we run our business involved the construction of a new set of roads connecting Lafayette and Austin directly, with most of the work running through the Brotherhood's old stomping grounds. They agreed to foot the bill for the project, but made it clear that it'd be awfully nice of us if we contributed more than we had to. It's an interesting idea, to be sure."
 tpm_a_day_off:0 "Callahan's Day Off"
 tpm_a_day_off_desc:0 "Callahan never really took to Keats like some other Texan leaders have. The guy's nice—nobody's disputing that—but Callahan's having trouble believing he's really that nice in a continuous manner. Like, come on, man, weren't you a soldier? How on God's green earth can you be so naively nice to everyone? We've gotta sort this thing out if we're gonna keep working with him."
