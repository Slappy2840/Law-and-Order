  GAM_cruel_heartland:0 "Cruel Heartland"
GAM_cruel_heartland_desc:0 "A lot of space is wasted of unnecessary buildings, like houses or clinics or even something as stupid as a farm. Burn them all down, that should give us room to expand."

GAM_territorial_reinforcement:0 "Territorial Reinforcement"
GAM_territorial_reinforcement_desc:0 "We need to both keep the slaves in and the rival gangs out. And for that we've organized a bunch of raiders to help build outposts along our borders. Staffing them is easy, as any gangmember worth his salt will want to be the first in the action."

GAM_skulls_on_sticks:0 "Putting Skulls on Sticks"
GAM_skulls_on_sticks_desc:0 "Y'know, you would think scaring people was easy. But nah, you have to think about it. Instead of just putting random body parts on sticks and spraying crude messages everywhere, our boys have found out it is far more effective to put a decapitated human head still having all it's skin."

GAM_terrorise_the_locals:0 "Terrorizing the Locals"
GAM_terrorise_the_locals_desc:0 "Sometimes, you just have to take care of simple matters. Threaten some locals, burn down some stuff in the distance, holler at them while firing in the air, that should calm anyone wanting to be a hero. That will also certainly relieve some stress in our boys while we wait for the next raid."

GAM_raider_headquarters:0 "Raider Headquarters"
GAM_raider_headquarters_desc:0 "What we need is a huge fortress. Something that will immediatly make rival gang cower! We'll have huge walls, entire rooms dedicated to weapon production, lots of slaves to build it even bigger and better! This will be awesome."

GAM_territoriality:0 "Territorial Loyalties"
GAM_territoriality_desc:0 "As we give more and more loot to our troops, they certainly take a liking in the lifestyle. Combine that with reminding them what generally happens to raiders caught by actual nations, and that will make them fight all the harder to keep this kinda life."

GAM_we_never_die:0 "We Never Die!"
GAM_we_never_die_desc:0 "Well I mean, except when we do. But you know what I mean, the gang never dies. I mean, there's just so much pillaging and looting and shooting, how could it ever? We keep getting more boys, we keep getting more recruits, and thus we keep getting more loot!"

GAM_manifest_destiny:0 "Manifest Destiny"
GAM_manifest_destiny_desc:0 "Look around, we're surrounded by mor-ons, and they're so weak too! They barely have anything on them, don't even know how to lift a rifle, why are we scared of them again? Their land, their loot, their cities? They should be ours. And we will make them ours, by force."

GAM_incorporate_slavers:0 "Incorporating Slavers"
GAM_incorporate_slavers_desc:0 "Yeah they kinda bum some of the boys out, with all the wailling and pleading and such. But slaves are so useful, we can't really go without them. You can make them do pretty much anything, and that includes making them think if they last more than five seconds on the frontline they'll be free..."

GAM_slave_labour:0 "Slave Labour"
GAM_slave_labour_desc:0 "Organizing massive slave recruitment and putting them to work on construction? Genius. Okay some of them might lose an arm or two from time to time, but you can't doubt that the brothel got built way faster than usual."

GAM_forced_labour:0 "Forced Labour"
GAM_forced_labour_desc:0 "You have to be smart when you use slaves. Push them just hard enough to have very good results, but not quite to kill or maim them. That takes a certain degree of skill, and with better training for our slave masters, we can make them work under the harsh desert sun on roads."

GAM_slave_scientists:0 "Enslaving Scientists"
GAM_slave_scientists_desc:0 "Listen, you see those big brains there? Well yeah, they don't look like much, but maybe, just maybe, they could actually give us better shooties and such. How about we just make them work for us? Watch them close and see how fast they make explosives when you have a gun pointed at them."

GAM_slave_researchers:0 "Slave Researchers"
GAM_slave_researchers_desc:0 "Supplementing our scientists with \"forcefully recruited\" engineers should make them work that much faster, and result in even more cool stuff for us to play with. Just imagine, we could maybe even have a gun that doesn't explode in your face!"

GAM_new_age_weaponry:0 "Shiny New Toys"
GAM_new_age_weaponry_desc:0 "Now look at this shiny weapon. I have no idea how it works, and maybe it doesn't look as flashy as black powder guns, but it punches right through any idiot thinking a bunch of scrap will save them. Ain't that just swell? Maybe we'll give the eggheads some booze."

GAM_guns_with_legs:0 "Guns with Legs"
GAM_guns_with_legs_desc:0 "Okay so see this trashcan? Well it has guns, and it has armor. It also doesn't die as easily. So how about we kick it in front of people, and when they run out of ammo we blast their ass? I know, i know, i should have been a tactician."

GAM_find_the_good_stuff:0 "The Good Stuff"
GAM_find_the_good_stuff_desc:0 "I have no idea what that stuff is, but the engineers keep saying we need it to make more trashcans, so... i guess we'll take it too? Never did that before, but then again, we never had mobile trash compactors blasting people with SMGs."

GAM_shitty_robots:0 "Shitty Robots"
GAM_shitty_robots_desc:0 "See all that fancy stuff there? Why do we even need it, it just keeps slowing production anyway. I dunno what a gyro is, or what \"keeping the robot from entering a catastrophic nuclear event\" even means, but I am sure we can pass on that. More guns!"

GAM_encourage_slavers:0 "Encouraging Slavers"
GAM_encourage_slavers_desc:0 "It might be pushing it a tad too far for some, but more slavers and more caps means way more slaves to use in our army. Which is always a good thing, of course, and we can always use them for other stuff later."

GAM_establish_the_slave_trade:0 "Cutting into the Slave Trade"
GAM_establish_the_slave_trade_desc:0 "We need to go local boys, no more external assets, no more bad deals, we are going to go into the slave trade and make our own company! Without quarterly reports and boring meetings, and with way more chems!"

GAM_drug_dealers:0 "Dealing Chems"
GAM_drug_dealers_desc:0 "Chems, the ultimate thing to use in any situation. Just avoid"

GAM_raid_workshops:0 "Stealing from the Competition"
GAM_raid_workshops_desc:0 "Okay so, how about instead of building stuff we just steal them? I mean, we're raiders, it does make sense. Would also save us the trouble."

GAM_supply_stashes:0 "Filling the Stash"
GAM_supply_stashes_desc:0 "We need more and more stuff to fuel our warmachine, water for the boys, scraps for the factories, get to it! Keep thinking about that shiny new APC you want, and you'll work even harder."

GAM_turn_the_lights_on:0 "Violently Kicking the Generator"
GAM_turn_the_lights_on_desc:0 "I have absolutely no idea why the engineers keep saying we need to kick stuff. You would think they need some proper care, but they keep talking about \"percussive maintenance\". Well alright then, just kick it i guess. Don't stand too close to it after though."

GAM_terminals_for_all:0 "Fixing Terminals"
GAM_terminals_for_all_desc:0 "Apparently, terminals would really let our eggheads write down stuff easier and go way faster in their research. So i so give them terminals. So much you can fill an entire room with them. I just want a new gun."

GAM_raider_computer_logs:0 "Keeping Logs"
GAM_raider_computer_logs_desc:0 "Keeping logs of our previous raids and actually reading, for a change, will let us see where the big fuck up happened. Maybe throwing dynamite around support beams wasn't the best idea, but next time we'll actually know that. I hope."

GAM_taking_the_best:0 "Taking the Best"
GAM_taking_the_best_desc:0 "Pretty advanced stuff right there, P-65 personal computer, top specs, you could maybe salvage the central processor as well as the quantum lock... why do you look at me like that? Get back to work idiot, we need to get those back to the eggheads!"

GAM_industrial_interest:0 "Stealing Tools"
GAM_industrial_interest_desc:0 "Apparently some of those slaves actually knew stuff. Stuff like the location of still running factories, the entry points, and the exact moment where everyone would be in the same room so you could throw a grenade. That does sound like a plan."

GAM_hideout_expansion:0 "Stolen Blueprints"
GAM_hideout_expansion_desc:0 "Okay so, it seems like we missed some stuff on the last run. Stuff like uh... entire piles of blueprints and advanced technical documents. Don't ask me, they only talked about tools back then. Anyway, let's go back."

GAM_slaver_settlement:0 "Slaving Hub"
GAM_slaver_settlement_desc:0 "Maybe we should give our slaves actual buildings. Would certainly improve morale and free up all the space the ramshackled camps occupy."

GAM_a_weapon_to_surpass_the_other_gang:0 "Heavy Metal Men"
GAM_a_weapon_to_surpass_the_other_gang_desc:0 "Ever since one of the boys saw a brotherhood soldier running around and not really caring about being shot at, he keeps pestering the scientists about it. They went to complain to other raiders, and when they told them why he was bothering them, everyone else joined in on the fun. I guess that means we get tin cans now?"

GAM_convert_metal_armour:0 "Ramshackle Supply"
GAM_convert_metal_armour_desc:0 "It might not really be power armor, but it still puts a few centimeters of armour between the squishy body and the very mean bullet coming at ya. So stop complaining and put it on, it will stop weighting so much in a bit, i swear."

GAM_power_armor_familiarity:0 "Everyone's Favourite Toys"
GAM_power_armor_familiarity_desc:0 "Why would anyone not want one of those? They're awesome! You can have grenades land right in front of you and not care, and the priceless look on the face of those settlers when they saw raiders in power armor was more than worth it!"

GAM_chop_shop_shimmy:0 "The Chop Shop Shimmy"
GAM_chop_shop_shimmy_desc:0 "We got plenty of vehicles running around, but nothing quite standardized. They're mostly ramshackled pieces of junks, and not really worth looking into. But we could also just beat the snot out of any drivers and engineers we encounter until they give us something we can make!"

GAM_gear_head_slaves:0 "Grease Monkeys"
GAM_gear_head_slaves_desc:0 "Having our slaves work in the garages is way better than spending time trying to fix those pieces of junks ourselves. With any luck they'll run for more than half a fuel tank before breaking something."

GAM_the_magnum_opus:0 "The Magnum Opus"
GAM_the_magnum_opus_desc:0 "This is it boys, we'll organize a massive competition to find the magnum opus! It has to be tough, big, scary, armed with huge guns! All the gang is getting into a frenzy to try and find the next ultimate death machine!"

GAM_prove_yourself:0 "Proving Yourself"
GAM_prove_yourself_desc:0 "If you want to lead our boys, you better prove you can. While that generally means that you beat someone to death with his own arm, sound tactical choices is also acceptable, i guess."

GAM_brutal_hazing:0 "Brutal Hazing"
GAM_brutal_hazing_desc:0 "Why train our troops when we can just dope them to hell and have them fight each other? Whoever's left is clearly more experienced than the other after all."

GAM_recruit_them_young:0 "Recruiting Them Young"
GAM_recruit_them_young_desc:0 "That would certainly bring more troops to the frontline, yeah. Just have to make sure they can actually lift the rifle, or aim it."

GAM_expand_the_garage:0 "Expanding the Garage"
GAM_expand_the_garage_desc:0 "You can be sure that as soon as someone talked about expanding the garage, every boy in the gang was listening. Who wouldn't want a roaring monstrosity of a vehicle all for themselves? It will be done faster than expired jet usage day"

GAM_kings_of_the_roads:0 "Kings of the Roads"
GAM_kings_of_the_roads_desc:0 "Ain't nobody as fast or as crazy as us! Roadblock, wrecks, entire blaster road, we don't care, we just ride right through full speed!"

GAM_custom_rides:0 "Custom Rides"
GAM_custom_rides_desc:0 "Custom rides, that's such a sweet thing to say. Bigger engine, better suspensions, louder exhausts, anything goes. And once in the fight, it certainly shows."

GAM_call_in_the_warboys:0 "Calling All Warboys"
GAM_call_in_the_warboys_desc:0 "When you call the warboys, you really toy with fire. They might be the best APC drivers in the wastes, but they also wreck themselves faster than you can ask for another jet. We can make good use of them, just don't stand too close to their rides."

GAM_metal_boxes:0 "Heavy Metal Boxes"
GAM_metal_boxes_desc:0 "Boxes! On wheels! All they need is lots of armors and lots of weapons. Anti-tank rifles, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, machineguns, you name it and we have it! Put it on the hatches, put it in the ball mounts, let's get this show on the road!"

GAM_roaring_machines:0 "Roaring Machines"
GAM_roaring_machines_desc:0 "As long as it roars, you can be sure the boys will want it. Any engine swap goes, as long as it can lift itself clean off the ground from sheer acceleration alone."

GAM_doped_soldiers:0 "Doped Raiders"
GAM_doped_soldiers_desc:0 "We got our hands on something called \"super jet\", and while nobody has an idea of where it comes from, it makes the boys mad as hell. Just pump them full of the stuff and unleash them on the enemy, just make sure to wait a long while after for the withdrawal to kick in, and don't mind the body parts"

GAM_lightning_raids:0 "Lightning Raids"
GAM_lightning_raids_desc:0 "We're in and we're out before they even know what happened. That's how it goes boys, we go in fast and hard, take their loot, take their slaves, take their lives!"

GAM_blood_soaked_gender_equality:0 "Gender Equality through Violence"
GAM_blood_soaked_gender_equality_desc:0 "We don't really discriminate around here. If you can throw a grenade far enough to land it where it's funny to watch it explode, or if you can slice someone's arm off with a machete, you're in."

GAM_take_what_you_need:0 "Taking What We Need"
GAM_take_what_you_need_desc:0 "Raiding, it's pretty simple business really. What's hard is seeing if it's really worth taking on that PA patrol, and how. But with some more experience against simple targets, we can improve our raiding techniques."

GAM_business_booms:0 "Business Booms"
GAM_business_booms_desc:0 "Business booms, artillery blooms and it certainly goes kaboom. Nobody is gonna complain about having heavy ordonnance on their side, except when it drops on their head by accident."

GAM_short_fused_engineers:0 "Short Fuse Engineering"
GAM_short_fused_engineers_desc:0 "More and more explosives are required to really have an advantage over other gang. Every boy in the troop has to have it's own stock of it, and for that it will take quite a bit of time. But all the screams and blown bits will make it worth it."

GAM_an_explosion_in_understanding:0 "An Explosion in Understanding"
GAM_an_explosion_in_understanding_desc:0 "That's what you could call it anyway, one of the boys blew himself up on experimental explosives and it apparently gave the eggheads some idea. If it makes them work faster, we'll throw people on top of mines at this rate."

GAM_starting_the_flow:0 "Starting the Flow"
GAM_starting_the_flow_desc:0 "We've recently been a bit short on sauce. Everyone knows sauce makes the world go round, but we don't got the caps to get any. A little 'talk' might loosen up the tap."

GAM_paying_the_boys:0 "Paying the Boys"
GAM_paying_the_boys_desc:0 "The gang is starting to get a bit roudy. They ain't be likin' the way things been going; too much poppin', not enough rockin'. If we give 'em a little kick back after a job well done, it should grease the gears."

GAM_beer_bonuses:0 "The Strong Stuff"
GAM_beer_bonuses_desc:0 "We're coming up short on the books. This ain't be pleasin' for the boys, but we have a solution boss. If we give em the cheapest hooch on this side of the continent, they won't know the purse is a little light!"

GAM_unrefusable_deal:0 "A Deal You Can't Refuse"
GAM_unrefusable_deal_desc:0 "Our gracious friends have been a bit.... conservative with their 'donations' I think if we'd go and give em a nice meal, we could make em an offer that helps them, and us ....but us a little extra."

GAM_victory_hits:0 "Victory Hits"
GAM_victory_hits_desc:0 "A job well done's a job well done. Sometimes, it's worth kickin' up with some fine hash and celebrating on a pile of corpses."

GAM_controlling_routes:0 "Controlling the Trade"
GAM_controlling_routes_desc:0 "A little negotiation to drive the underworld into our world could help us out big time. The bigwigs call it 'Horizontal Integration.' The only thing horizontal will be the people who don't cooperate."

GAM_art_of_sack:0 "Art of the Sack"
GAM_art_of_sack_desc:0 "Despite the pillaging, destruction, and general unkindly and roudy behavior, sacking a nice town is an art. We're the Picasso of drugs and caps. A splash here, line there, exacution in the left corner. If the 'raid' venture bellys up, at least we're artists!"

GAM_kingpins:0 "Kingpins"
GAM_kingpins_desc:0 "In the big books, the kings and queens weren't always the good guys. Sometimes we need to employ some more... unsavory means for cooperation, but at least we got the good of the gang at heart. And the gang, they're all that matters."
