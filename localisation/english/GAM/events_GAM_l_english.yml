    nf_gam.1.d:0 ""You promised us your aid if we needed it! We sent you food when you were at death's door and you promised you'd pay us back! With Texas looking east, do you really think now is the time to—"\nSobek was getting bored with the ghoulish envoy. "Yeah, yeah. 'Cause you're all too weak to stand and fight, we know."\nThe ghoul looked as if he'd been punched. "I've been alive since the days of America! I saw my wife and children slaughtered before my eyes two centuries ago! Do you really think I've lived this long just to be lectured at by a child?"\nSobek cracked a grin. Then she laughed a long, uproariously loud laugh. Then she whipped a pistol out of her kimono's chest holster and shot the ghoul dead on the spot. He fell to the dirty ground of the Alexandria town hall building with an ignominious thump. "Hey, Daren, clean that up."\n"Yes, boss." Daren Carter, the boss's head janitor, fetched a mop and bodybag while the rest of the gang leaders had a good laugh and dispersed.\nSobek stared at the dead ghoul's corpse laying on the ground while it got cleaned up, then rested her chin on her upright right hand when it had gone. The crown of gator hide and teeth had started feeling weird, so she took it off and threw it to the floor near where Daren was cleaning up. "Tired'a wearin' this fuckin' thing," she complained. Then she stretched her legs out squealed for an instant, and hopped right off her makeshift throne.\n"Need me to pack it up, boss?"\n"Yeah, that'd be nice. Gonna get some air. Maybe kill a guy."\n"Who's on the choppin' block today?"\n"Eh, I don't like Clarence anymore. He's been too shifty lately."\nDaren nodded. "Yeah, I've been seein' him outa town in some weird places. I's up in Natchit yesterday to pick up some meds for my Ma and he's up there chattin' up the doctor lady. Didn't see what they'd talkin' about but she gave 'em some pills for somethin'."\nSobek smiled briefly. "Well, finish up and come with me. We're gonna figure it out."\nDaren paused thoughtfully, then shrugged. "Sounds like a fun time, boss." He finished cleaning up the ghoul's mess, then the pair left the town hall together, talking about what little they knew about their heritage. The gator crown sat lying on the empty floor."

    nf_gam.2.d:0 "Sobek gave Clarence another good kick across the jaw, and he let out a blood-curdling scream. "So, y'gonna tell us what those pills were, hm?"\nBetween groans and sobs Clarence tried to speak. "I... I told you—ahh... I told you it was just... *sniff* just painkillers for Thomas... I..." Clarence curled up in a fetal position in the mud and cried, rubbing his bloodied face.\n"Oh, boo hoo," Sobek taunted. She sat down on Clarence's curled body. "Look, d'ya have those pills on you or not?"\n"No, I—" he coughed up a spot of blood. "Thomas has them. He's... he's by the old church, I think... Please..."\n"Well, guess we can't verify that claim. Sorry, bucko!" Sobek pressed her pistol to the back of Clarence's head. He wailed and begged for mercy. After a minute of patient waiting, Sobek pulled the trigger. There was a click, and Sobek let out a solid laugh. "Guess the gator's gonna let you live this once, Clarence. Cheer up, it's your lucky day!" She stood up and leaned over Clarence. After a minute or two of quiet crying, Clarence finally uncovered his face and peaked up at Sobek. She gave him one last solid kick in the face. Not enough to kill the guy, but there was a definite crack from his nose, and Clarence resumed his bubbled screaming. "Look alive, bandit," she cooed. Then she turned to acknowledge her clapping audience of one. "Daren? Got other shit to do, y'know."\n"Right, boss." He stood up, and they walked away from the miserable ball of flesh known as Clarence who wouldn't shut up and stop writhing in the mud. It'd been a hard task to convince Clarence to leave his buddies without getting him into a defensive mindset, but once he was away and out in a nearby back alley, it was amazing what a simple kick to the nuts could do for a boy. "So, what've we gotta do next, chief?"\n"Chief?" Sobek stopped walking and turned to face Daren. "Remember what I told ya 'bout callin' me chief?"\nDaren bowed his head and put his hands together, clearly requesting a pardon. "Sorry, boss. You know it's a tough habit to break."\nSobek spit at his shoes. "Well, try harder, fuckface. Tired of everyone acting like I'm some gift from god meant to guide them through all their troubles. I am the trouble." She looked him up and down. "Alright, you're forgiven, idiot. Come on, we've gotta check on the slave gangs before sunset." Daren nodded appreciatively and fell in behind Sobek. They talked about what the slaves from Lafayette were working on as they walked. After another hour of relative quiet, Clarence finally pulled himself together and stumbled home."

    nf_gam.3.t:0 "The Kid in the Mud"
    nf_gam.3.d:0 ""So how's the work goin', Claw?" Sobek walked up next to Theodore "Big Teddy" Claw and crossed her arms. "Noticin' there ain't any bodies yet."\nClaw chuckled. "Well, the day's still young. Ain't no guarantee bodies won't hit the ground before the day's end." The slaves Claw oversaw were in the process of dragging a long set of chains to the shore from the marshy riverside. A traveler’s boat had recently gotten caught in the weeds. The traveler walked to Alexandria for help, explained his situation, and got gutted on the spot. All that was left to do was salvage the loot.\n"Hey, watch this." Sobek drew her pistol and fired once in the air, earning a few screams and swears from the slaves. They stopped pulling the chains. "Hey, slimeballs! Did I say you could stop?" Sobek stopped shouting and walked down the bank towards the slaves. She waited for a moment for someone to speak. Nobody did. "Did I say you could stop?" Low murmurs in the negative were the only response. "Well, get back to it! And just for that delay, you've got 5 minutes to prove your worth. Slowest working one gets shot!" The slaves looked at each other, then really threw their backs into it, pulling with twice as much effort as they'd previously shown. After two minutes of watching closely, one old man threw his back out and fell out of line. "Ooh, that's too bad. Sorry, guy!" Sobek raised her pistol and shot the man directly between his eyes. Some of the other slaves screamed and a young boy dropped his chain and ran to the old man, crying. "Aw, that's cute. D'ya wanna join your grandpappy?" Sobek raised her pistol at the boy. Another slave—a middle-aged woman this time—set her chain down and stepped in front of Sobek. She looked scared, but her breathing was even.\n"Please kill me instead of the boy, if you must kill again." Sobek aimed her pistol at the woman's head and held it there for a minute. Then she pulled the trigger and there was another click. She let out a good laugh, and the rest of the overseer gang on the nearby bank had a solid chuckle as well. Only after the woman let out a sigh of obvious relief did Sobek give her a sharp jab in the gut, sending her keeling over. "Ha, man, that was good. You can have a minute break, then back to work!" She whipped her pistol around in the air and walked back up the bank.\n"That was funny, boss," Claw admitted. "Could've kept the old man though. He's not a good worker but him bein' around helped the other slaves keep in better spirits. They're gonna miss him and resent you for it."\n"Eh, he was probably on death's bed anyways," Sobek noted with a shrug. "Fucker should be thankin' me for speedin' up the process. Keep an eye on 'em and shoot that lady if she causes any more trouble. Got a feelin' she's pregnant." Sobek let out a light giggle. "Sorry. Was."\n"Got it, boss." Claw turned away to keep watching the slaves, occasionally barking orders, and Sobek walked off with Daren in tow, talking about how funny it was to keep Claw around despite the threat he posed."

    nf_gam.4.t:0 "Pillar of Fire" #burnin' ring a fire
    nf_gam.4.d:0 ""Fire's a beautiful thing," Sobek explained. Patrol Chief Callahan didn't really have much of a choice but to listen. "See, it takes all that neat little stuff like wood and paper and clothes and people and it all turns it into the same thing." She smiled. "Turns 'em all to ash. And I've gotta lotta problems I've needed turned to ash over the last few months. Lotta them start and end with you and your precious patrol." She stopped smiling. "C'mere, prick.""Look, lady, I know you hate us and all, but—""Shut up, bitch." Sobek gave the chief a slug to the gut, and he exhaled sharply and bent over gasping. His hands were tied like all the other patrol leads with him, so there wasn't much he could do but cough repeatedly. "See this orphanage?" She motioned to the Lafayette City Orphanage building in front of the assembled procession. All the children had been freed from its clutches and all the workers inside the building had been shot dead where they stood. That was days ago, and the bodies hadn't been touched. Callahan finally stopped coughing and looked up. "That fuckin' building is where y'all ruined my life. Or tried your best. Look what you did. Y'all took an ordinary girl and put so much hate into 'er that she became a bandit queen and slaughtered your patrol." She grinned again and walked up to Callahan. She ripped his badge off his shirt, tore his hat from his head, and grabbed his shades from his face. She snapped them in two. The chief didn't so much as flinch. Then she grabbed the man's moustache and pulled his face down to her level. "Here's what I'm gonna do," she whispered to the chief's sad pokerface. "First, I'm gonna take every patrol lead here and I'm gonna put 'em in that building. Then I'm gonna throw in one pistol with enough shots for each of them. Then I'm gonna set the building on fire. How's that sound?"The chief only looked sad. Not horrified or angry, just sad. "That'd be a mighty waste of fine men and ammo, ma'am." Sobek gave him a firm slap across the face and back up. "Now!" She clapped twice in a royal manner she'd heard of in a book she hadn't read, and the dozen or so patrol leads were shuffled into the building. An old man entered last, and while the rest of the patrol leads looked angry or scared, the old man gave Sobek the same sad look Callahan bore. That pissed her off, so Sobek took a shot at the old man's shoulder for good measure. His face twisted with pain, but the sad look didn't go away until his face disappeared into the building. A few minutes later, the structure burned bright. A minute or so into that, a series of popping shots fired off. It kept popping until one bullet was left. The last bullet never fired, and the chief only sat down on the ground and shook his head. "As for you," Sobek noted, "I'm gonna do you a favor. Gonna let you live. Moreover, gonna turn you into the creature our gang's named after. You're gonna be a gator." She smiled, and Callahan's ashen face looked up at her, confused. Then Sobek put three bullets into each of the chief's legs, illiciting an increasing howl of pain with each entry. "Now crawl to freedom, big guy. Crawl." After a quiet moment of moaning Callahan began to crawl away."Any further orders, boss?" Daren approached Sobek and bowed lightly."Yeah. Set some buildings on fire. Your call, or let the rest of the Maws choose. Have some fun. Then we're going home." Daren distributed torched to Sobek's entourage and spread out into the smoke-filled night."

    nf_gam.5.t:0 "Gators Galore"
    nf_gam.5.d:0 "Sobek sat down on one of the benches lining The Cannery's portside boardwalk. Coincidentally, it happened to have been pried up from another spot nearby and sat there by one of here guards specifically because it faced where Mayor Ship-Breaker now sat. Ship-Breaker himself looked unusually old and jaded, like he'd been around since the bombs dropped but just never bothered getting ghoulified. "So," he asked, "what's your plan here?"Sobek frowned. "Hm. I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. See, you've got a nice operation goin' on here. When we took our Lafayette, that was personal. Got a bone to pick with the patrol freaks and I picked their bones 'till I was satisfied. But you? Got nothin' against you, you're just old and ugly."Ship-Breaker managed a shaky chuckle between coughs. "Thanks for the compliment.""See, New Orleans is over east, and that seems like a lotta work. Texas ain't our problem, the Desperados are more fun to mess with than to bother fightin', and ain't no way we're growin' frog legs and becoming pirates. But this little stretch'a land here really felt like the loose end, y'know?"Ship-Breaker nodded slowly. "I understand what you mean.""So we figured we'd just kinda... y'know... take it. And here we are." Sobek smiled with her hands outstretched to her sides, then she clasped them down on her knees. "So I've got a few options. I could just kill you and everyone else here and be done with it. Burn the bayou and sell the cannery's last batch to passing pirates.""Seems like a waste, if you ask me.""I didn't, and I wouldn't." Sobek looked to her side down the rest of the empty boardwalk. "But you're right. I know my folks sure as hell don't wanna spend the rest'a their days in some factory. And, uh..." She looked up at Teddy Claw, who was one of the attending guards. "Well, Teddy's good at keepin' slaves in order and all, but somethin' tells me we couldn't whip machinery to work faster.""That is correct," Ship-Breaker remarked. He was beginning to get a twinkle in his eye, Sobek noticed. Weird."So our other option's pretty much this. Turn y'all into a tribute port. You keep runnin' your business as is, stop huntin' pirates, and let us deal with them. Turn The Cannery into a real bandit port, y'know. You can run the day to day, but if you slip up even once it'll be your head and every head on this island that rolls. Think you can manage that for me?"Ship-Breaker smiled. "I think I can stay in line, chief." Sobek smiled wide at Ship-Breaker, then drew her pistol and shot him in his foot. He swore under his breath and gripped the thing. She leaned forward so far she could feel the old man's uneasy breath. "That's for callin' me chief," she whispered. Then she got up and walked away, with the rest of her guard in tow."
    nf_gam.5.a:0 "Fine, you can stay mayor. But watch yourself."

    nf_gam.6.t:0 "The Crowning of the Gator Queen"
    nf_gam.6.d:0 "§R"§RWear the crown!§! §RWear the crown!§! §RWear the crown!§!"§! Nearly every member of the gang had been packed into the Alexandria town hall for the specific purpose of making Sobek wear a crown. Sobek did not want to wear that crown.\n"I don't want to wear that crown," Sobek said.\nTeddy Claw walked up to the makeshift throne—now custom adorned with a long row of blue-hatted and cyan-glasses skulls—and knelt before it. He bowed low and raised the newly-reforged Gator Crown as high as his fat arms could manage. The crown itself had been a custom job by a passing ex-Ironmonger pirate who stopped in the recently-piratified port of The Cannery, incorporating scrap metal from the twisted remains of the Lafayette Orphanage a chunk taken off the Mama Dulces, the Bayou Motors' beached canning vessel. It had 10 gator teeth sticking up out its sides spaced evenly across, a string of brass across the main band from melted-down Patrolmen badges, and a hand-carved wooden alligator head set into the front tip of the crown. All in all, a rather tacky piece, Sobek thought. But still...\nShe stood up. "How about this. I'll wear the stupid crown on a few conditions." Cheers went up from the tightly-crowded room. "First of all, the Gator Maws aren't a tribe. We're a gang. Get that through your heads, the lottaya. Got it?" Some people towards the back made sad noises, but most of the gang members shouted points of affirmation. "Secondly, y'all gotta call me the Gator Queen from now on." Universal shouts and whoops went up from the crowd. This was playing right into a cheesy legend that'd been going around Alexandria for a century, but if it would put a rest to the legend for good, it'd be worth it. "Finally. Heya, Claw, stand up." Claw stood, smiled, and did a poorly-imitated military salute. "If I put this stupid crown on my head, can I shoot you in your fuckin' knee?"\nClaw's face fell and he looked nervous. But a new chant of "say yes!" went up from the rest of the crowd, and after hyping himself up on everyone else's approval, he returned to the front of the throne and bowed again. "If it means your crowning, your reptilian majesty, I'll do it."\nSobek smiled wide. "Oh, and Daren too. You up?"\nDaren didn't miss a beat from his place next to the throne. "If the boss wants it," he said meekly.\n"Well, the boss most certainly does." She whipped her pistol out of her kimono, gave it a fancy twirl she'd practiced for far too long, and nailed Claw and Daren in their left knees with one bullet each. Both fell to the ground groaning, but both kept their pain-ridden faces lifted towards Sobek. As for Sobek, she had a good laugh, then shouted "Alright, let's have this stupid fuckin' crown." She reached down to where Claw was holding it up towards her, stood up on her throne, dramatically set her right leg onto one of the throne's armrests, and crowned herself then and there. She did a dramatic pose she saw on a comic book cover one time, and the crowd went wild."
