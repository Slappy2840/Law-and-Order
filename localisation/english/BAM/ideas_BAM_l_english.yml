       bam_obvious_target_desc:0 "Our position as a port directly on the Gulf of Mexico has done wonders for our ability to can and ship recently-caught fish and shrimp to a wide variety of customers around the Gulf and into the Caribbean, but our easy accessibility and relatively small coastal defense force has also meant we're frequently targetted for hit-and-run pirate attacks. It's been a few years since the last one, but every couple fishing seasons we get that one douchebag sloop that thinks it can just run up on us and steal a ship or extract a bribe to go away or something. It's not great for stability, but it does mean plenty of altruists and privateers enjoy serving in our navy simply for the likelihood of a safe challenge."

       bam_merchant_cannery_desc:0 "The Cannery was founded a little over half a century ago by a small group of entrepreneurs looking to fix up the old cannery ship Mama Dulces, which beached itself on Marsh Island just after the Great War. The venture succeeded, a small flow of immigration to the island popped up, a port was built on the southeastern corner of the island with a boardwalk road for small vehicles to transport supplies to and from The Cannery, and we've been running a successful operation ever since. Even since the founding of our humble set of settlements, we've attracted merchant interests from all over the Gulf, and plenty of small coastal cities have made deals with us to help feed their populaces. We keep the prices low as long as they send us back whatever empty cans and scrap they find lying around, and the system seems to be fairly stable for long-term profits."

Even from our earliest days we suffered pirate raids, but then-captain Ship-Breaker went out of his way to spread the word that we'd pay top dollar for protection against petty raids, and so the mercs came. Realistically, we're not worth the effort of a raid from most of the strongest pirate groups running around the Caribbean, so only the small guys try to take us on, and that's perfectly fine for the mercenaries that come to the Cannery looking for a happy retirement and occasional light action."

While mercenaries and merchants are both common enough sights, our humble port has become a favorite rest stop for many shipping companies and private operators making the Gulf Circuit, and our reliable schedule and crime-free port has earned a positive name in sailor circles far and wide."

       bam_francophones:0 "The Cajuns are a small cultural remnant from old world America. Apparently there used to be a bunch of them, but now it's pretty much down to the main group over in Port Cypermort and a splinter group in New Orleans. They speak American English like any normal folks, of course, but they're also fluent in a weird dialect of an otherwise dead language called "French." Most of them seem to insist that their heritage is significant in some way. We can't really understand it, but the fact that they know a language nobody else knows has made them particularly useful when it comes to getting a leg up on knowing what everyone around us is doing. Can't figure out if someone's spying or just plain stupid if he's speaking gibberish to you."

We lost a few good men when they blew up the security gate guarding our port's main entrance, but that aside not much actual damage was done. We've compensated the families of the deceased and sent our small fleet of angry mercenary friends chasing the pirates to the ends of the gulf and back, but realistically not much changed for the raid. Still, let's use it to get some folks to work a little harder while it's still fresh in their minds."

Nah, we're just a buncha humble fishermen and privateers. Long as the waves are free to sail, we'll have no want for other people's land. Still, we'd be naive to think other people don't want our land for some reason or another, so let's take the effort to make sure they can't get our land. It'd be a darn shame to let a setup this nice get taken by someone who didn't deserve to have it."

We're an underdog that everyone can root for, and hoo boy, did we ever have a David and Goliath moment for a little bit there. Anywho, now there's somethin' weird goin' on in the Cannery Port. People are still coming for business, shipping, refueling, and mercenary work like usual, but there's a new flavor of folks stopping by, and it's really messin' with the local's heads. We've been getting tourists. Now that's a scary idea."
